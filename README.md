**Google AI Agents Intensive - 5 Day Workshop Capstone Project**

An intelligent job application tracking system powered by Google's Gemini AI, built to solve the real-world problem of managing multiple job applications efficiently.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This AI agent helps job seekers:
- 📝 Track all applications in one centralized database
- 🔄 Monitor application status and progress
- 🔍 Research companies quickly
- ⏰ Set automated follow-up reminders
- 📊 Visualize job search analytics

### Why This Project?

After months of job hunting with applications scattered across emails, spreadsheets, and sticky notes, I built this intelligent assistant to streamline my job search process. This capstone project demonstrates practical AI agent development while solving a genuine personal challenge.

### My Journey 🚀

I started the Google AI Agents Workshop knowing basic Python but had never built a complete AI agent before. Over 5 days, I learned how to:
- Design agent architectures
- Integrate tools with LLMs
- Manage state and memory
- Evaluate quality
- Deploy production-ready code

This tracker represents not just what I learned, but a tool I actually need and will use in my own job search!

## ✨ Features

- **Natural Language Interface**: Interact with your job tracker using conversational queries
- **Persistent Storage**: SQLite database maintains complete application history
- **Intelligent Tools**: 7 custom tools for comprehensive job tracking:
  - Save applications with details
  - Query and filter applications
  - Update application status
  - Research company information
  - Generate cover letter drafts
  - Calculate success metrics
  - Set follow-up reminders
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in quality metrics and evaluation
- **Visual Analytics**: Interactive charts and statistics dashboard

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Workshop Concepts Demonstrated

| Day | Concept | Implementation | Status |
|-----|---------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Agent Architecture | JobSearchAgent with Gemini 2.0 Flash | ✅ |
| 2 | Tool Integration | 7 custom tools with function calling | ✅ |
| 3 | Memory & Context | SQLite + conversation history | ✅ |
| 4 | Quality & Evaluation | Metrics tracking & monitoring | ✅ |
| 5 | Production Ready | Error handling + logging | ✅ |

### Tech Stack

- **AI Model**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (via API)
- **Database**: SQLite3
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Processing**: Pandas
- **Language**: Python 3.11+

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install google-generativeai pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaiRitwik11/ai-job-application-tracker.git
cd ai-job-application-tracker
```

2. Set up your Google API key:
```python
# Option 1: Environment variable
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Option 2: Kaggle Secrets (if running on Kaggle)
# Configured automatically
```

3. Run the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebook/ai-job-application-tracker.ipynb
```

### Usage Examples

```python
# Initialize the agent
agent = JobSearchAgent(use_mock=False)  # Set to True for demo mode

# Save a new application
agent.process_query(
    "I applied to Google for a Software Engineer position in Bangalore"
)

# Check your applications
agent.process_query("Show me all my applications")

# Update status
agent.process_query("Update application #1 to Interviewing")

# Set reminder
agent.process_query("Set a reminder for application #2 in 7 days")

# View statistics
agent.process_query("Show my job search statistics")
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Applications Table
- Basic info: company, role, location, salary range
- Status tracking: Applied, Interviewing, Assessment, Offer, etc.
- Timestamps: applied_date, last_updated, follow_up_date

### Activity Log
- Complete audit trail of all actions
- Timestamps and detailed descriptions

### Metrics Table
- Performance metrics: response times, success rates
- Quality monitoring data

## 🔍 Key Implementation Details

### Intelligent Query Processing

The agent uses pattern matching (in mock mode) or Gemini's NLU (in API mode) to understand user intent:

```python
# Examples of understood queries:
"I just applied to Microsoft for a Data Scientist role"
"Show me applications with status Interviewing"
"What's my success rate?"
"Remind me to follow up with Amazon in 5 days"
```

### Mock Mode

To demonstrate architecture without consuming API quota:
- Uses pattern matching for query understanding
- Executes real tool functions
- Saves actual data to database
- Perfect for testing and demos

```python
agent = JobSearchAgent(use_mock=True)
```

## 📈 Sample Output

```
🎬 DEMO: Saving Job Applications
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Query: I just applied to Google for SWE in Bangalore
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✅ Response (0.35s):

Got it! I've saved your application:
• Company: Google
• Role: Software Engineer
• Application ID: #1

Good luck! I'll help you track this. 🎯
